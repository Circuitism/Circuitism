# Chapter 15: Building the New Economy — A Practical Field Guide

The principles of Circuitism are not abstract ideals; they are design specifications for a functioning economic system. This chapter moves from theory to practice, outlining the core institutional and entrepreneurial building blocks of a regenerative economy. This is a field guide for the builders, the entrepreneurs, the community organizers, and the investors who will construct the new system from the ground up.

The work of building the new economy can be understood as weaving a new fabric of value, one thread at a time. This fabric is composed of three primary types of organizations:

**1. The Commons-Based Venture**

This is the regenerative alternative to the traditional, extractive startup. Instead of being owned by a small group of founders and venture capitalists, the commons-based venture is owned by its stakeholders: its users, its workers, its community, and the ecosystem it serves.

*   **Legal Structure:** These ventures often use cooperative or multi-stakeholder ownership models. They are legally bound to a charter that prioritizes their regenerative mission over pure profit maximization.
*   **Funding:** They are capitalized not by venture capital seeking a 100x exit, but by patient, mission-aligned capital from community investment funds, public banks, and individuals who want a fair return on an investment that also generates social and ecological value.
*   **Examples:** Platform cooperatives for ride-sharing or food delivery; community-owned renewable energy utilities; open-source software projects governed by their user communities.

**2. The Bioregional Trust**

This is the institutional container for managing shared resources at a bioregional scale. The Trust acts as a steward for the natural commons—the forests, the watersheds, the fertile soils—that are the foundation of all economic activity.

*   **Governance:** The Trust is governed by a board of trustees representing the diverse interests of the bioregion: indigenous leaders, farmers, scientists, local government officials, and community representatives.
*   **Function:** It monitors the health of the ecosystem, sets sustainable harvest limits, and collects rents and fees from commercial users of the commons. These revenues are then reinvested in ecological restoration and distributed as a citizen's dividend, ensuring that the value generated by the commons is shared by all.
*   **Data Integration:** The Trust is a hub for ecological data, using a network of sensors and citizen science initiatives to create a real-time, high-resolution picture of the bioregion's health. This data is a public good, used to inform policy, guide investment, and empower citizens.

**3. The Value-Flow Protocol**

This is the digital infrastructure that enables the seamless flow of value through the regenerative economy. It is the open-source protocol layer that replaces the proprietary platforms of the old economy.

*   **Core Features:** The protocol integrates a multi-layered currency system (including national currencies, local currencies, and reputation-based currencies), a decentralized identity system that gives individuals control over their own data, and a system of "smart contracts" that can automate the complex agreements of a stakeholder-owned economy.
*   **Function:** It allows for the creation of new kinds of economic relationships. For example, a farmer could be automatically rewarded with a specialized "carbon credit" currency for sequestering carbon in their soil, a currency that could then be used to pay their taxes or to buy goods and services from other regenerative businesses. It makes the invisible work of regeneration visible and economically viable.

**The Strategy: Weave the New Fabric**

These three organizational forms are the looms, shuttles, and threads of the new economy. The strategy is not to tear down the old fabric, but to weave the new one within it. We start by building a single commons-based venture. We connect it to a bioregional trust. We use the value-flow protocol to create a new circuit of exchange between them. Then we add another venture, and another.

Slowly, patiently, we weave a new fabric of economic life that is more resilient, more equitable, and more alive than the one it replaces. This is not the work of a single hero or a single revolution. It is the distributed, decentralized work of millions of people, each weaving their own small patch of a new and more beautiful world.
