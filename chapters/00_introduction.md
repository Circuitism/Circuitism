# Introduction

Our systems don't fail by accident; they fail by design. The introduction lays out the core argument: war, poverty, genocide and collapse are not moral failures, but outputs of broken architectures. Circuitism offers a systems-engineering approach to civilization â€” a blueprint for continuous balance and regenerative flow, not extraction. This sets the tone for a rigorous, scientific exploration of rebuilding our economic and social logic from the ground up.
