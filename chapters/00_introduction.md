# Introduction

Our world isn’t failing because of individual greed or bad politics. It’s failing because the systems we’ve built reward extraction over flow, accumulation over balance, and dominance over coherence.

War, poverty, genocide — these aren’t random tragedies or moral lapses. They are predictable outcomes of an economic architecture designed to concentrate energy and value into isolated nodes, until the whole field collapses.

Circuitism is not a new ideology. It is an engineering framework. It treats civilization as a living circuit — an interconnected energy system that must stay balanced to survive.

In this model, value is measured by how well it keeps the circuit flowing, not by how much it can be hoarded. Ownership is replaced by stewardship. Innovation is judged by its ability to reduce entropy and improve coherence, not by its short-term disruption or profit.

This book is not about utopia. It is about design logic.
It is not about revolution. It is about rewiring the system to make collapse structurally impossible.

The following chapters outline this framework in detail, covering energy science, biology, psychology, anthropology, governance, and technical implementation. They show how we move from an economy that breeds collapse to one that can regenerate indefinitely.

This is not a theory. It’s an operating manual for a world that works — and keeps working.
