# Harmonic Mathematics — Designing Coherence in Complex Systems

Introduces the mathematics of feedback, recursion, and attractors. Uses fractals (e.g., Mandelbrot, Burning Ship) as metaphors for societal outcomes based on different "function parameters." Explains how coherent mathematical functions lead to regenerative, stable systems — while chaotic functions result in collapse.
