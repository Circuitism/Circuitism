# Circuitism

**"Engineering a Living, Balanced Economy"**

Circuitism is a new economic and civilizational operating system that treats all value — labor, capital, ecology, social trust, and attention — as energy moving through a living circuit.

War, poverty, and genocide are not moral failures; they are system failures. They are discharges of blocked or hoarded energy in outdated economic architectures. Circuitism redesigns civilization at the root by building continuous flow, systemic feedback, and regenerative balance into every interaction.

**Core Principle**: No node can hoard beyond its regenerative capacity. Value is measured by contribution to overall flow and coherence, not accumulation.

"This repository contains an open-source book presenting a hard systems blueprint for a world that stays balanced and resilient."
