# Circuitism: The Operating System for Civilization

**"A Blueprint for a Regenerative Civilization"**

Circuitism is a new economic and civilizational operating system that treats all value—labor, capital, ecology, social trust, and attention—as energy moving through a living circuit. It posits that our most critical global crises, from ecological collapse to extreme inequality, are not moral failures but engineering failures. They are the predictable outcomes of an outdated economic architecture designed for extraction and hoarding.

This repository contains the complete manuscript for the book "Circuitism," which lays out a hard systems blueprint for a world built on the principles of continuous flow, systemic feedback, and regenerative balance. It is an open-source framework for a civilization that functions like a healthy ecosystem—stable, resilient, and alive.

**Core Principle**: Value is not measured by accumulation, but by an actor's contribution to the overall health and coherence of the system. No node can hoard energy or resources beyond its capacity to use them regeneratively.
